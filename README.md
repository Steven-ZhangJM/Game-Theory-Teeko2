# Game-Theory-Teeko2
The Teeko2 rules are almost identical to those of Teeko but we will exchange a rule. Specifically, we remove the 2x2 box winning condition and replace it with a 3x3 box winning condition -- same colored markers at the four corners of a 3x3 square. Mathematically, if (i,j) is the center of a 3x3 board, then it must be that (i,j) is empty and that there is a marker of the appropriate color on each of (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), and (i+1,j+1).
